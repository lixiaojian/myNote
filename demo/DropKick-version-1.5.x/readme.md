DropKick 1.5.x
=
Creating custom dropdowns is usually a tedious process that requires a ton of extra setup time. Oftentimes lacking conveniences that native dropdowns have such as keyboard navigation. DropKick removes the tedium and lets you focus on making s@#t look good.

Requirements:
-
DropKick requires the latest version of jQuery, available at jQuery.com. Currently we're [using jQuery 1.10.2.](http://blog.jquery.com/2013/07/03/jquery-1-10-2-and-2-0-3-released/)

How it works:
-
DropKick works by transforming your existing, boring `<select>` lists into beautiful, customizable HTML dropdowns. The name attribute is the only one that is required. You should also set a tabindex attribute to enable navigation via tabbing.
When an option is selected in a DropKick menu, the corresponding `<select>` value is updated. This means that your forms and AJAX requests should work the same without having to make any changes.

Features:
-
* *Acts Just Like A Select*
* *Keyboard Navigation:*
   Keyboard navigation in DropKick is very similar to native `<select>` navigation.
   While highlighted, pressing enter, up, or down on your keyboard will open the dropdown.
   While opened, pressing up or down will navigate through the options, and pressing enter will select the currently highlighted option.

* *Dynamic Selects:*
 Use `$(object).dropkick('refresh')` method to update dropkick if the `<select>` content has changed dynamically

* *Theming:* 
  DropKick was made to be easily theme-able and supports dynamic theme changing.

* *Custom Callbacks*

How to use:
-
* Make sure you have jQuery 1.7.1 or later running
* Add all the DK files to their proper spots (CSS files can be added to your main CSS file if you like)
* Set a `class` or `id` on the select(s)
* Call `$('#select').dropkick();`
* Have a happy time with new awesome selects!

Please see examples.html or [the DropKick homepage](http://robdel12.github.com/DropKick/) for more ways to use DK.


Compatibility:
-
DropKick was tested on Opera 10+, Google Chrome 10+, FireFox 5+, Safari 5+, and Internet Explorer 7+. IE6 is not supported and will simply continue using your plain dropdowns instead.

Whats new in 1.5?
-
* Added "optgroup" support
* Improved "disabled" suport
* Provides 'clone' and 'destroy' useful methods
