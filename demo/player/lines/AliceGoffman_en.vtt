1
00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:16.791
On the path that American children travel to adulthood,

2
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:20.339
two institutions oversee the journey.

3
00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.082
The first is the one we hear a lot about: college.

4
00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:26.665
Some of you may remember the excitement that you felt

5
00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:29.251
when you first set off for college.

6
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.803
Some of you may be in college right now

7
00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:34.818
and you're feeling this excitement at this very moment.

8
00:00:35.808 --> 00:00:37.487
College has some shortcomings.

9
00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:40.823
It's expensive; it leaves young people in debt.

10
00:00:40.823 --> 00:00:43.767
But all in all, it's a pretty good path.

11
00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:48.934
Young people emerge from college with pride and with great friends

12
00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:51.273
and with a lot of knowledge about the world.

13
00:00:51.273 --> 00:00:53.109
And perhaps most importantly,

14
00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.615
a better chance in the labor market than they had before they got there.

15
00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:00.318
Today I want to talk about the second institution

16
00:01:00.318 --> 00:01:05.876
overseeing the journey from childhood to adulthood in the United States.

17
00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:09.631
And that institution is prison.

18
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:14.356
Young people on this journey are meeting with probation officers

19
00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:16.759
instead of with teachers.

20
00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.652
They're going to court dates instead of to class.

21
00:01:20.652 --> 00:01:25.729
Their junior year abroad is instead a trip to a state correctional facility.

22
00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.419
And they're emerging from their 20s

23
00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:31.616
not with degrees in business and English,

24
00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:33.634
but with criminal records.

25
00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:36.927
This institution is also costing us a lot,

26
00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:38.569
about 40,000 dollars a year

27
00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.337
to send a young person to prison in New Jersey.

28
00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:45.543
But here, taxpayers are footing the bill

29
00:01:45.543 --> 00:01:49.026
and what kids are getting is a cold prison cell

30
00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:51.836
and a permanent mark against them when they come home

31
00:01:51.836 --> 00:01:54.585
and apply for work.

32
00:01:54.585 --> 00:01:58.031
There are more and more kids on this journey to adulthood

33
00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:03.255
than ever before in the United States and that's because in the past 40 years,

34
00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:09.007
our incarceration rate has grown by 700 percent.

35
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:11.136
I have one slide for this talk.

36
00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:12.390
Here it is.

37
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.443
Here's our incarceration rate,

38
00:02:15.443 --> 00:02:21.735
about 716 people per 100,000 in the population.

39
00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:25.885
Here's the OECD countries.

40
00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:33.437
What's more, it's poor kids that we're sending to prison,

41
00:02:33.437 --> 00:02:36.925
too many drawn from African-American and Latino communities

42
00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:41.806
so that prison now stands firmly between the young people trying to make it

43
00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:45.238
and the fulfillment of the American Dream.

44
00:02:45.238 --> 00:02:48.094
The problem's actually a bit worse than this

45
00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:50.772
'cause we're not just sending poor kids to prison,

46
00:02:50.772 --> 00:02:53.739
we're saddling poor kids with court fees,

47
00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.060
with probation and parole restrictions,

48
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.947
with low-level warrants,

49
00:02:57.947 --> 00:03:01.442
we're asking them to live in halfway houses and on house arrest,

50
00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:05.047
and we're asking them to negotiate a police force

51
00:03:05.047 --> 00:03:07.460
that is entering poor communities of color,

52
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.659
not for the purposes of promoting public safety,

53
00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.135
but to make arrest counts, to line city coffers.

54
00:03:18.357 --> 00:03:22.745
This is the hidden underside to our historic experiment in punishment:

55
00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:27.791
young people worried that at any moment, they will be stopped, searched and seized.

56
00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:31.078
Not just in the streets, but in their homes,

57
00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:33.515
at school and at work.

58
00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:37.936
I got interested in this other path to adulthood

59
00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:40.177
when I was myself a college student

60
00:03:40.177 --> 00:03:42.235
attending the University of Pennsylvania

61
00:03:42.235 --> 00:03:44.313
in the early 2000s.

62
00:03:44.313 --> 00:03:47.880
Penn sits within a historic African-American neighborhood.

63
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.118
So you've got these two parallel journeys going on simultaneously:

64
00:03:53.118 --> 00:03:56.239
the kids attending this elite, private university,

65
00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.705
and the kids from the adjacent neighborhood,

66
00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.633
some of whom are making it to college,

67
00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:04.131
and many of whom are being shipped to prison.

68
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:09.235
In my sophomore year, I started tutoring a young woman who was in high school

69
00:04:09.235 --> 00:04:12.229
who lived about 10 minutes away from the university.

70
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.762
Soon, her cousin came home from a juvenile detention center.

71
00:04:15.762 --> 00:04:18.420
He was 15, a freshman in high school.

72
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.079
I began to get to know him and his friends and family,

73
00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.431
and I asked him what he thought about me writing about his life

74
00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:28.016
for my senior thesis in college.

75
00:04:28.016 --> 00:04:32.207
This senior thesis became a dissertation at Princeton

76
00:04:32.207 --> 00:04:33.755
and now a book.

77
00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:35.353
By the end of my sophomore year

78
00:04:35.353 --> 00:04:38.723
I moved into the neighborhood and I spent the next six years

79
00:04:38.723 --> 00:04:43.314
trying to understand what young people were facing as they came of age.

80
00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:46.138
The first week I spent in this neighborhood,

81
00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:48.714
I saw two boys, five and seven years old,

82
00:04:48.714 --> 00:04:50.206
play this game of chase,

83
00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:53.157
where the older boy ran after the other boy.

84
00:04:53.157 --> 00:04:54.352
He played the cop.

85
00:04:54.352 --> 00:04:56.540
When the cop caught up to the younger boy,

86
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.240
he pushed him down,

87
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.791
handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs,

88
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:03.102
took a quarter out of the other child's pocket,

89
00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:06.694
saying, "I'm seizing that."

90
00:05:06.694 --> 00:05:10.034
He asked the child if he was carrying any drugs

91
00:05:10.034 --> 00:05:12.479
or if he had a warrant.

92
00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.484
Many times, I saw this game repeated,

93
00:05:14.484 --> 00:05:16.872
sometimes children would simply give up running,

94
00:05:16.872 --> 00:05:19.068
and stick their bodies flat against the ground

95
00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:22.413
with their hands above their heads, or flat up against a wall.

96
00:05:22.413 --> 00:05:24.408
Children would yell at each other,

97
00:05:24.408 --> 00:05:25.690
"I'm going to lock you up,

98
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.872
I'm going to lock you up and you're never coming home!"

99
00:05:28.872 --> 00:05:33.226
Once I saw a six-year-old child pull another child's pants down

100
00:05:33.226 --> 00:05:35.636
and try to do a cavity search.

101
00:05:36.576 --> 00:05:39.755
In the first 18 months that I lived in this neighborhood,

102
00:05:39.755 --> 00:05:43.447
I wrote down every time I saw any contact between police

103
00:05:43.447 --> 00:05:45.993
and people that were my neighbors.

104
00:05:46.373 --> 00:05:48.472
So in the first 18 months,

105
00:05:48.472 --> 00:05:52.241
I watched the police stop pedestrians or people in cars,

106
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:54.409
search people, run people's names,

107
00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.353
chase people through the streets,

108
00:05:56.353 --> 00:05:58.126
pull people in for questioning,

109
00:05:58.126 --> 00:06:02.309
or make an arrest every single day, with five exceptions.

110
00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:06.897
Fifty-two times, I watched the police break down doors,

111
00:06:06.897 --> 00:06:08.938
chase people through houses

112
00:06:08.938 --> 00:06:12.157
or make an arrest of someone in their home.

113
00:06:12.157 --> 00:06:14.970
Fourteen times in this first year and a half,

114
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.270
I watched the police punch, choke, kick, stomp on or beat young men

115
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.089
after they had caught them.

116
00:06:24.109 --> 00:06:26.485
Bit by bit, I got to know two brothers,

117
00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:28.029
Chuck and Tim.

118
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.070
Chuck was 18 when we met, a senior in high school.

119
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.618
He was playing on the basketball team and making C's and B's.

120
00:06:34.618 --> 00:06:36.517
His younger brother, Tim, was 10.

121
00:06:36.517 --> 00:06:39.668
And Tim loved Chuck; he followed him around a lot,

122
00:06:39.668 --> 00:06:41.959
looked to Chuck to be a mentor.

123
00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:44.105
They lived with their mom and grandfather

124
00:06:44.105 --> 00:06:47.544
in a two-story row home with a front lawn and a back porch.

125
00:06:47.544 --> 00:06:51.205
Their mom was struggling with addiction all while the boys were growing up.

126
00:06:51.205 --> 00:06:55.053
She never really was able to hold down a job for very long.

127
00:06:55.062 --> 00:06:58.101
It was their grandfather's pension that supported the family,

128
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:01.304
not really enough to pay for food and clothes

129
00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:04.035
and school supplies for growing boys.

130
00:07:04.035 --> 00:07:06.221
The family was really struggling.

131
00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:08.600
So when we met, Chuck was a senior in high school.

132
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.718
He had just turned 18.

133
00:07:11.448 --> 00:07:14.590
That winter, a kid in the schoolyard

134
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.849
called Chuck's mom a crack whore.

135
00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:20.724
Chuck pushed the kid's face into the snow

136
00:07:20.724 --> 00:07:24.549
and the school cops charged him with aggravated assault.

137
00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:26.299
The other kid was fine the next day,

138
00:07:26.299 --> 00:07:29.772
I think it was his pride that was injured more than anything.

139
00:07:29.772 --> 00:07:31.485
But anyway, since Chuck was 18,

140
00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:34.673
this age, assault case sent him to adult county jail

141
00:07:34.673 --> 00:07:37.098
on State Road in northeast Philadelphia,

142
00:07:37.098 --> 00:07:41.165
where he sat, unable to pay the bail -- he couldn't afford it --

143
00:07:41.165 --> 00:07:44.364
while the trial dates dragged on and on and on

144
00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:47.086
through almost his entire senior year.

145
00:07:47.746 --> 00:07:50.796
Finally, near the end of this season,

146
00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:54.143
the judge on this assault case threw out most of the charges

147
00:07:54.143 --> 00:07:55.477
and Chuck came home

148
00:07:55.477 --> 00:07:59.824
with only a few hundred dollars' worth of court fees hanging over his head.

149
00:07:59.824 --> 00:08:02.367
Tim was pretty happy that day.

150
00:08:02.367 --> 00:08:05.121
The next fall, Chuck tried to re-enroll as a senior,

151
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:07.135
but the school secretary told him that

152
00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:10.266
he was then 19 and too old to be readmitted.

153
00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:13.933
Then the judge on his assault case issued him a warrant for his arrest

154
00:08:13.933 --> 00:08:17.208
because he couldn't pay the 225 dollars in court fees

155
00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:20.735
that came due a few weeks after the case ended.

156
00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:24.755
Then he was a high school dropout living on the run.

157
00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:26.807
Tim's first arrest came later that year

158
00:08:26.807 --> 00:08:28.590
after he turned 11.

159
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.720
Chuck had managed to get his warrant lifted

160
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.381
and he was on a payment plan for the court fees

161
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:36.891
and he was driving Tim to school in his girlfriend's car.

162
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.626
So a cop pulls them over, runs the car,

163
00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:43.411
and the car comes up as stolen in California.

164
00:08:43.411 --> 00:08:47.534
Chuck had no idea where in the history of this car it had been stolen.

165
00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:51.010
His girlfriend's uncle bought it from a used car auction

166
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.477
in northeast Philly.

167
00:08:52.477 --> 00:08:55.305
Chuck and Tim had never been outside of the tri-state,

168
00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:57.654
let alone to California.

169
00:08:57.654 --> 00:08:59.752
But anyway, the cops down at the precinct

170
00:08:59.752 --> 00:09:03.320
charged Chuck with receiving stolen property.

171
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.132
And then a juvenile judge, a few days later,

172
00:09:06.132 --> 00:09:08.284
charged Tim, age 11,

173
00:09:08.284 --> 00:09:11.357
with accessory to receiving a stolen property

174
00:09:11.357 --> 00:09:15.010
and then he was placed on three years of probation.

175
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.152
With this probation sentence hanging over his head,

176
00:09:19.152 --> 00:09:21.239
Chuck sat his little brother down

177
00:09:21.239 --> 00:09:24.688
and began teaching him how to run from the police.

178
00:09:24.688 --> 00:09:27.020
They would sit side by side on their back porch

179
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.084
looking out into the shared alleyway

180
00:09:29.084 --> 00:09:32.924
and Chuck would coach Tim how to spot undercover cars,

181
00:09:32.924 --> 00:09:37.891
how to negotiate a late-night police raid, how and where to hide.

182
00:09:38.831 --> 00:09:40.511
I want you to imagine for a second

183
00:09:40.511 --> 00:09:42.880
what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like

184
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.629
if they were living in a neighborhood where kids were going to college,

185
00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.058
not prison.

186
00:09:49.738 --> 00:09:52.891
A neighborhood like the one I got to grow up in.

187
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:54.356
Okay, you might say.

188
00:09:54.356 --> 00:09:58.108
But Chuck and Tim, kids like them, they're committing crimes!

189
00:09:58.108 --> 00:10:00.234
Don't they deserve to be in prison?

190
00:10:00.234 --> 00:10:04.048
Don't they deserve to be living in fear of arrest?

191
00:10:04.048 --> 00:10:07.170
Well, my answer would be no.

192
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.250
They don't.

193
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.277
And certainly not for the same things that other young

194
00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:14.721
people with more privilege are doing with impunity.

195
00:10:14.721 --> 00:10:16.538
If Chuck had gone to my high school,

196
00:10:16.538 --> 00:10:18.861
that schoolyard fight would have ended there,

197
00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:20.537
as a schoolyard fight.

198
00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:24.087
It never would have become an aggravated assault case.

199
00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:27.578
Not a single kid that I went to college with

200
00:10:27.578 --> 00:10:29.257
has a criminal record right now.

201
00:10:29.257 --> 00:10:31.131
Not a single one.

202
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:35.136
But can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids

203
00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:39.003
and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class?

204
00:10:39.003 --> 00:10:43.064
Or had raided their frat parties in the middle of the night?

205
00:10:44.204 --> 00:10:45.476
Okay, you might say.

206
00:10:45.476 --> 00:10:47.466
But doesn't this high incarceration rate

207
00:10:47.466 --> 00:10:50.219
partly account for our really low crime rate?

208
00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:52.643
Crime is down. That's a good thing.

209
00:10:52.643 --> 00:10:55.130
Totally, that is a good thing. Crime is down.

210
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.657
It dropped precipitously in the '90s and through the 2000s.

211
00:10:58.657 --> 00:11:00.702
But according to a committee of academics

212
00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:04.356
convened by the National Academy of Sciences last year,

213
00:11:04.356 --> 00:11:08.365
the relationship between our historically high incarceration rates

214
00:11:08.365 --> 00:11:11.949
and our low crime rate is pretty shaky.

215
00:11:11.949 --> 00:11:15.389
It turns out that the crime rate goes up and

216
00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:19.915
down irrespective of how many young people we send to prison.

217
00:11:21.085 --> 00:11:24.178
We tend to think about justice in a pretty narrow way:

218
00:11:24.178 --> 00:11:27.782
good and bad, innocent and guilty.

219
00:11:27.782 --> 00:11:31.137
Injustice is about being wrongfully convicted.

220
00:11:31.137 --> 00:11:33.452
So if you're convicted of something you did do,

221
00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:35.287
you should be punished for it.

222
00:11:35.287 --> 00:11:37.053
There are innocent and guilty people,

223
00:11:37.053 --> 00:11:39.490
there are victims and there are perpetrators.

224
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.891
Maybe we could think a little bit more broadly than that.

225
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:48.325
Right now, we're asking kids who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods,

226
00:11:48.325 --> 00:11:50.606
who have the least amount of family resources,

227
00:11:50.606 --> 00:11:53.167
who are attending the country's worst schools,

228
00:11:53.167 --> 00:11:56.073
who are facing the toughest time in the labor market,

229
00:11:56.073 --> 00:11:59.726
who are living in neighborhoods where violence is an everyday problem,

230
00:11:59.726 --> 00:12:04.299
we're asking these kids to walk the thinnest possible line

231
00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:08.110
to basically never do anything wrong.

232
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.611
Why are we not providing support to young kids facing these challenges?

233
00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:19.857
Why are we offering only handcuffs, jail time and this fugitive existence?

234
00:12:19.857 --> 00:12:22.363
Can we imagine something better?

235
00:12:22.363 --> 00:12:26.618
Can we imagine a criminal justice system that prioritizes recovery,

236
00:12:26.618 --> 00:12:29.205
prevention, civic inclusion,

237
00:12:29.205 --> 00:12:31.906
rather than punishment?

238
00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:41.950
A criminal justice system that acknowledges

239
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.930
the legacy of exclusion that poor people of color in the U.S. have faced

240
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.086
and that does not promote and perpetuate those exclusions.

241
00:12:55.111 --> 00:12:59.673
And finally, a criminal justice system that believes in black young people,

242
00:12:59.673 --> 00:13:03.537
rather than treating black young people as the enemy to be rounded up.

243
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.107
The good news is that we already are.

244
00:13:14.107 --> 00:13:18.930
A few years ago, Michelle Alexander wrote "The New Jim Crow,"

245
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.943
which got Americans to see incarceration as a civil rights issue

246
00:13:22.943 --> 00:13:27.299
of historic proportions in a way they had not seen it before.

247
00:13:27.299 --> 00:13:31.058
President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have come out very strongly

248
00:13:31.058 --> 00:13:32.775
on sentencing reform,

249
00:13:32.775 --> 00:13:36.519
on the need to address racial disparity in incarceration.

250
00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:39.129
We're seeing states throw out Stop and Frisk

251
00:13:39.129 --> 00:13:42.165
as the civil rights violation that it is.

252
00:13:42.165 --> 00:13:47.220
We're seeing cities and states decriminalize possession of marijuana.

253
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.077
New York, New Jersey and California

254
00:13:49.077 --> 00:13:52.914
have been dropping their prison populations, closing prisons,

255
00:13:52.914 --> 00:13:55.195
while also seeing a big drop in crime.

256
00:13:55.195 --> 00:13:56.888
Texas has gotten into the game now,

257
00:13:56.888 --> 00:14:00.733
also closing prisons, investing in education.

258
00:14:00.733 --> 00:14:04.390
This curious coalition is building from the right and the left,

259
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.838
made up of former prisoners and fiscal conservatives,

260
00:14:07.838 --> 00:14:11.169
of civil rights activists and libertarians,

261
00:14:11.169 --> 00:14:15.149
of young people taking to the streets to protest police violence

262
00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:17.985
against unarmed black teenagers,

263
00:14:17.985 --> 00:14:20.031
and older, wealthier people

264
00:14:20.031 --> 00:14:21.902
some of you are here in the audience

265
00:14:21.902 --> 00:14:25.837
pumping big money into decarceration initiatives

266
00:14:27.177 --> 00:14:28.927
In a deeply divided Congress,

267
00:14:28.927 --> 00:14:31.630
the work of reforming our criminal justice system

268
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.422
is just about the only thing that the right and the left

269
00:14:34.422 --> 00:14:37.007
are coming together on.

270
00:14:37.007 --> 00:14:40.921
I did not think I would see this political moment in my lifetime.

271
00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:44.530
I think many of the people who have been working tirelessly

272
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.692
to write about the causes and consequences

273
00:14:46.692 --> 00:14:48.924
of our historically high incarceration rates

274
00:14:48.924 --> 00:14:52.690
did not think we would see this moment in our lifetime.

275
00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:56.473
The question for us now is, how much can we make of it?

276
00:14:56.473 --> 00:14:59.438
How much can we change?

277
00:14:59.438 --> 00:15:02.002
I want to end with a call to young people,

278
00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:03.636
the young people attending college

279
00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:06.746
and the young people struggling to stay out of prison

280
00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:09.850
or to make it through prison and return home.

281
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.883
It may seem like these paths to adulthood are worlds apart,

282
00:15:13.883 --> 00:15:18.325
but the young people participating in these two institutions

283
00:15:18.325 --> 00:15:20.250
conveying us to adulthood,

284
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.815
they have one thing in common:

285
00:15:22.815 --> 00:15:27.497
Both can be leaders in the work of reforming our criminal justice system.

286
00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:31.635
Young people have always been leaders in the fight for equal rights,

287
00:15:31.635 --> 00:15:33.900
the fight for more people to be granted dignity

288
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.455
and a fighting chance at freedom.

289
00:15:36.455 --> 00:15:38.834
The mission for the generation of young people

290
00:15:38.834 --> 00:15:43.814
coming of age in this, a sea-change moment, potentially,

291
00:15:43.814 --> 00:15:49.078
is to end mass incarceration and build a new criminal justice system,

292
00:15:49.078 --> 00:15:52.005
emphasis on the word justice.

293
00:15:52.005 --> 00:15:53.409
Thanks.
